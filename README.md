# Javascript-Advanced-Project

## Introduction

This is a web application built to encourage reading.

## Technologies 

The app is completely built with vanilla javascript so there is no need to install anything.

### General information 

As said, this web application is built to encourage reading, it was built as the project for my javascript advanced course. By using the textbox to search for a genre a list of books is provided. Clicking on a specific book's title shows its description, helping you find the best suited book for your taste!
